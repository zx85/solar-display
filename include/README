This directory is intended for project header files.

To make this work, a file called `settings.h` should be created in here, containing 
the folllowing definitions (and substituting your own values)

```
const char solarURL[] = "SOLIS_API_URL";
const char solisKey[] = "YOUR_SOLIS_KEY";
const char solisSecret[] = "YOUR_SOLIS_SECRET";
const char solisId[] = "YOUR_SOLIS_SYSTEM_ID";
const char solisSn[] = "YOUR_INVERTER_SERIAL_NUMBER";

```

Note: no need to include http:// in the solarserver address
Note again: currently this only works with http - not https
