This directory is intended for project header files.

To make this work, a file called `settings.h` should be created in here, containing 
the folllowing definitions (and substituting your own values)

```
// char ssid[] = "YOURSSID";        
// char pass[] = "YOURWIFIPASSWORD"; 
// const char solarserver[] = "WEBSERVERIPADDRESS";
// const char solarpath[] = "/PATH/TO/FILE.json";
```

Note: no need to include http:// in the solarserver address
Note again: currently this only works with http - not https
